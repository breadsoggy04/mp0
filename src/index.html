    <p>Hi, my name is Anuraag! I am a senior studying mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois with a minor in computer science. I am interested in working in the aerospace industry, specfically in aerostructures or aerodynamics teams. I also want to learn more about computer science. </p>
    <p>I have research experience through the MechSe department and I co-oped at Collins Aerospace. Outside, of school, I like to go running, hiking or anything to do with the outdoors.</p>
